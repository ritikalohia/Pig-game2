# Pig-game 2

IT IS THE MODIFIED VIERSION OF PIG GAME.
GAME RULES: 
-The game has 2 players, playing in rounds -In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. 
Each result get added to his ROUND score
-BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost.After that,  it's the next player's turn 
-The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score.After that, it's the next player's turn. 
-The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.  


  -A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row.After that, it's the next 
    player's turn. (HINT: Always save the previous dice roll in a separate variable).
  -Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the
    predefined score 100, (HINT: you can read that value with the .value property in javascript. This is a 
        good oppurtunity to use google to figure this out)
  -Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score when 
    one of them is a 1. (HINT: you will need CSS to position the second dice, so take a look at the CSS code
        for the first one.)
